# Fiber Bundle Semantics

UOR organizes typed data using the mathematical structure of a fiber bundle. Understanding
fiber bundles explains why types in UOR behave the way they do, and why the
{@concept partition} exists as a structural separator between kernel and user concerns.

## What Is a Fiber Bundle?

A fiber bundle consists of three components:

1. **Total space E**: the full collection of all typed data
2. **Base space B**: the address space — the set of all possible content addresses
3. **Fiber F**: the type (or set of types) that lives over each address

For every address b in B, there is a fiber F_b — a set of valid types at that address.
The total space E is the disjoint union of all fibers: E = ∪_{b∈B} F_b.

In UOR, the base space is the {@class https://uor.foundation/u/UniversalAddress} space
(grounded in the {@concept ring} Z/(2^8)Z), and fibers are `type:Fiber` instances — the
possible types attached to a given address. See {@concept content-addressing} for how
the base space is defined.

## The `type` Namespace

The `type` namespace is the User-space implementation of fiber bundle semantics.
Key classes:

- `type:Fiber` — the fundamental typed layer over an address
- `type:FlatType` — a fiber with trivial (non-twisted) holonomy
- `type:TwistedType` — a fiber with nontrivial holonomy (monodromy acts non-trivially)
- {@class https://uor.foundation/type/CompleteType} — a fiber whose completeness has
  been certified
- {@class https://uor.foundation/type/TypeSynthesisGoal} and
  {@class https://uor.foundation/type/TypeSynthesisResult} — classes for the psi-pipeline
  inversion: computing what type is needed given a constraint

## The `partition` Namespace

The {@ns partition} namespace implements the decomposition of the base space. An address
space can be partitioned into disjoint subsets (fibers in the partition sense), and UOR
uses this to implement namespace-level modularity. See {@concept partition} for full detail.

Key classes:

- {@class https://uor.foundation/partition/Partition} — a decomposition of the address space
- {@class https://uor.foundation/partition/PartitionProduct} — the Cartesian product of two
  partitions (the full space)
- {@class https://uor.foundation/partition/PartitionCoproduct} — the disjoint union of two
  partitions (exclusive choice)

The {@prop https://uor.foundation/partition/isExhaustive} property asserts that a partition
covers the entire space — a formal completeness claim implemented in OWL.

## Connection to Holonomy

When a fiber is transported around a loop in the base space, it may return to a different
element of the fiber — this transformation is the **holonomy**. If all holonomies are trivial
(the identity), the bundle is flat (`type:FlatType`). Otherwise, it is twisted
(`type:TwistedType`).

The {@class https://uor.foundation/observable/HolonomyGroup},
{@class https://uor.foundation/observable/Monodromy}, and
{@class https://uor.foundation/observable/MonodromyClass} classes in the Bridge space observe
these holonomy phenomena. See {@concept observables} for how measurement works.

Monodromy — the representation of the fundamental group of the base space in the
holonomy group — is detected by the `MonodromyResolver` and recorded in
`MonodromyClass` individuals.

## Superposed Fiber States

A fiber need not be in a definite type state. The `SuperposedFiberState` and
`CollapsedFiberState` classes implement quantum superposition at the type level.

- A `SuperposedFiberState` is a linear combination of fiber types, weighted by amplitudes
- A `CollapsedFiberState` is the result of measurement — a definite type

This superposition is not merely formal. The `SuperpositionResolver` resolves the
superposed state, and the {@class https://uor.foundation/cert/MeasurementCertificate}
certifies that the collapse event followed Born rule probabilities.

## Partition Decomposition and the PRISM Pipeline

The partition structure mediates between the Kernel (Define stage) and the User types
(Resolve stage) of the {@concept prism} pipeline:

- **Kernel** defines the address space and {@concept ring} arithmetic
- **{@concept partition}** (Bridge) decomposes the address space into fibers
- **Type** (User) assigns typed meaning to each fiber
- **{@concept resolution}** (Bridge) computes what type is at each address
- **Certification** ({@ns cert}) certifies that the typing is consistent

The fiber bundle semantics is what makes UOR more than a list of algebraic facts — it is
a structured framework for typed computation over a content-addressed address space.
