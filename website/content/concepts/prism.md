# The PRISM Pipeline

PRISM is the three-stage operational pipeline of the UOR Foundation ontology:
**Define → Resolve → Certify**. Each stage corresponds to a space in the three-space
hierarchy, and together they form a complete circuit from raw structure to certified truth.

## Overview

Every computable identity in UOR travels the PRISM pipeline. A claim about the ring
is first defined in the Kernel, then resolved by the Bridge, and finally certified in the
certification layer. The pipeline is not a metaphor: it is implemented in the 16 namespaces
assembled in dependency order, with the `cert` namespace sitting at the apex.

The name PRISM captures the dual role of the pipeline: it refracts abstract structure into
computable forms (the dispersive function of a prism), and it certifies identities with
cryptographic precision (the certification function).

## Stage 1 — Define (Kernel)

The Kernel space comprises the three foundational namespaces: `u`, `schema`, and `op`.

- **`u` (Universal)**: The `u:UniversalAddress` class establishes the address space.
  The `u:ContentAddressed` and `u:Identifiable` classes ground every UOR object in a
  content-addressable location. Nothing in UOR exists without an address.

- **`schema` (Schema)**: The `schema:Ring` and `schema:QuantumLevel` classes define the
  algebraic substrate. This is where Q0–Q3 are declared and the ring structure is encoded
  formally in OWL.

- **`op` (Operations)**: The `op:Operation` hierarchy defines what operations are possible
  over ring elements. The 424 named algebraic identities (`op:Identity` individuals)
  live here — these are the theorems that the pipeline must eventually certify.

The Define stage answers: *what exists and what are its algebraic laws?*

## Stage 2 — Resolve (Bridge)

The Bridge space comprises 10 namespaces: `query`, `resolver`, `type`, `partition`,
`observable`, `homology`, `cohomology`, `proof`, `derivation`, and `trace`.

These namespaces implement the computational resolution of algebraic claims:

- **`query` / `resolver`**: The query-resolver pair implements type-directed search and
  incremental completeness resolution. The `resolver:CompletenessResolver` and
  `resolver:QuantumLevelResolver` compute which identities hold at which quantum levels.

- **`type` / `partition`**: The type namespace implements the fiber bundle structure —
  types are fibers over addresses. The partition namespace decomposes the address space.

- **`observable` / `homology` / `cohomology`**: These namespaces observe algebraic
  invariants: spectral sequences, holonomy groups, monodromy classes, and Euler
  characteristics.

- **`proof` / `derivation` / `trace`**: The proof namespace defines `proof:ComputationCertificate`
  and `proof:AxiomaticDerivation` — the two fundamental proof species. The derivation
  namespace records how one identity follows from another. The trace namespace records
  geodesic paths and measurement events.

The Resolve stage answers: *how do we compute this and what evidence does the computation produce?*

## Stage 3 — Certify (cert)

The `cert` namespace stands alone in the certification layer. Despite being in the Bridge
space (it imports Bridge namespaces), it plays the Certify role: it takes the evidence
produced by the Resolve stage and issues formal certificates.

Key certificate classes:

- `cert:CompletenessAuditTrail` — certifies that a completeness resolution is exhaustive
- `cert:GeodesicCertificate` — certifies that a computation follows the geodesic (shortest)
  path in the space of derivations
- `cert:SaturationCertificate` — certifies that the context is fully saturated

The 424 proof individuals in the `proof` namespace each correspond to one of the 424
named identities. Every proof individual is an `op:Identity` that has been resolved and
is awaiting or holding a certification.

The Certify stage answers: *has this been verified to the required standard?*

## The 57 Amendments

The UOR ontology has evolved through 57 amendments, each adding or refining structure.
The amendments are not arbitrary patches — each one closes a gap identified through
conformance testing. The progression from 97 conformance checks (Amendment 24) to
308 checks (Amendment 57) reflects the tightening of the conformance net around the
PRISM pipeline.

Key milestones:
- Amendments 1–20: Core kernel and bridge structure
- Amendments 21–22: Homology and cohomology namespaces
- Amendment 23: Typed controlled vocabularies (12 enum classes)
- Amendments 25–30: Completeness, quantum scaling, session scope, synthesis, spectral sequences, monodromy
- Amendments 31–36: Gap closures, measurement boundaries, geodesic computation
- Amendments 37–40: Further gap analysis and tooling
- Amendments 41–44: Quantum level scaling, arbitrary-Q generalization
- Amendments 45–49: Self-auditing conformance, meta-validation, gap closure, multi-session coordination, conformance release
- Amendments 50–53: PRISM website refactor, uniform navigation, seven-format artifact suite, Witt–carry formalization
- Amendments 54–57: Homotopy nerve, homotopy pipeline, moduli space, moduli resolver

## Conformance as Truth

The 308 conformance checks are not tests — they are the specification. Every check
defines a property that the ontology must have. When a check passes, it is a proof that
the pipeline is correctly implemented in that dimension.

The website you are reading was generated from the ontology itself. Every namespace page,
every identity count, every class hierarchy diagram is derived from `Ontology::full()` at
generation time. The site is not documentation of the pipeline — it is an instance of it.
