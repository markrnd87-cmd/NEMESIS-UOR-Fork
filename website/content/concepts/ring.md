# The Ring Substrate

Every UOR computation operates over a ring — specifically the modular integer ring Z/(2^n)Z,
where n is determined by the quantum level. This document explains the ring structure, its
physical motivation, and how it grounds the entire ontology.

## What Is a Ring?

A ring is an algebraic structure with two operations, addition and multiplication, satisfying
familiar laws: addition is commutative and associative, multiplication is associative and
distributes over addition, and there exist additive and multiplicative identities.

In UOR, the foundational ring is the byte ring Z/(2^8)Z — integers modulo 256. Every address
in the universal address space, every content-addressed datum, and every identity proof
ultimately reduces to arithmetic in this ring.

The ring is not merely metaphorical. The {@class https://uor.foundation/schema/Ring} class
captures its algebraic structure formally: the {@prop https://uor.foundation/schema/bitsWidth}
property records the bit-width n, and the {@class https://uor.foundation/schema/QuantumLevel}
individuals Q0–Q3 index the tower of sub-rings Z/(2^1)Z ⊂ Z/(2^2)Z ⊂ Z/(2^4)Z ⊂ Z/(2^8)Z.

## Quantum Levels Q0–Q3

The ring admits a natural four-level scaling (see {@concept quantum-levels} for full detail):

- **Q0** — 1-bit ring Z/(2)Z. Boolean arithmetic. The atom of all computation.
- **Q1** — 2-bit ring Z/(4)Z. Four elements. The minimal nontrivial modular structure.
- **Q2** — 4-bit ring Z/(16)Z. Nibble-width. Supports geometric intuitions (four quadrants).
- **Q3** — 8-bit ring Z/(256)Z. Byte-width. The universal content-addressing granularity.

Each level is a {@class https://uor.foundation/schema/QuantumLevel} individual with
{@prop https://uor.foundation/schema/quantumIndex} (0–3),
{@prop https://uor.foundation/schema/bitsWidth} (1, 2, 4, 8), and
{@prop https://uor.foundation/schema/cycleSize} (2, 4, 16, 256). The
{@prop https://uor.foundation/schema/nextLevel} property chains them: Q0 → Q1 → Q2 → Q3.

Validity in UOR is scoped per quantum level via `ValidityScopeKind`: a theorem can be
`Universal` (valid at all levels), `ParametricLower` (valid at level ≥ k),
`ParametricRange` (valid between k_min and k_max), or `LevelSpecific` (valid only at
exactly one level).

## The `bitsWidth` Property

The {@prop https://uor.foundation/schema/bitsWidth} data property records how many bits a
quantum level occupies. This is not an annotation — it drives computation. The
{@class https://uor.foundation/op/QuantumLevelBinding} class links operations to their
required quantum level, ensuring that proofs and computations are always validated at the
correct ring scale.

## Content Addressing via the Ring

The universal address space in {@class https://uor.foundation/u/UniversalAddress} is
grounded in byte-ring arithmetic. An address is a point in Z/(2^8)Z^d for some dimension d.
Content-addressed objects are identified by their position in this space, making the ring the
literal substrate of every UOR identity. See {@concept content-addressing} for more on the
address space.

The critical identities in {@ind https://uor.foundation/op/criticalIdentity} — the
{@count:identities} named algebraic identities — are theorems over this ring: equations that
hold in Z/(2^n)Z for the appropriate quantum level, certified by the proof individuals in
the {@ns proof} namespace. See {@concept proof-system} for the certification pathway.

## Connection to the PRISM Pipeline

The ring substrate flows through all three {@concept prism} stages:

- **Define (Kernel)**: The {@ns schema} namespace defines the ring itself and its quantum levels.
  The {@ns op} namespace defines operations over ring elements.
- **Resolve (Bridge)**: Resolvers in the {@ns resolver} namespace compute in the ring.
  The {@concept partition} decomposes the ring into fibers. Homological namespaces
  study ring-level algebraic invariants ({@concept homology}).
- **Certify (cert)**: Certificates in the {@ns cert} namespace attest to ring-level identities
  holding at specific quantum levels, producing the completeness and geodesic certificates
  that close the pipeline.

The ring is the ground on which the entire UOR ontology stands.
