# uor-foundation

The complete [UOR Foundation](https://uor.foundation/) ontology encoded as
typed Rust traits. Import and implement.

## Contents

- 16 namespaces
- 213 OWL classes (one trait each)
- 436 OWL properties (one method each)
- 758 named individuals (constants and enums)

## Quick start

```toml
[dependencies]
uor-foundation = "5.0.0"
```

```rust
use uor_foundation::Primitives;

struct MyImpl;
impl Primitives for MyImpl {
    type String = str;
    type Integer = i64;
    type NonNegativeInteger = u64;
    type PositiveInteger = u64;
    type Decimal = f64;
    type Boolean = bool;
}
```

Then implement any foundation trait with your chosen primitives:

```rust,ignore
use uor_foundation::bridge::partition::FiberBudget;

impl FiberBudget<MyImpl> for MyFiberBudget {
    // ...
}
```
