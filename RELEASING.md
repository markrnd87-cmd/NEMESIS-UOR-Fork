# Releasing

## Prerequisites

- `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` org secret configured at `github.com/UOR-Foundation`
  (Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions). The token must have permission
  to publish both `uor-foundation` and `uor-foundation-macros`.

## Release Process

1. Update `version` in the workspace root `Cargo.toml`:
   ```toml
   [workspace.package]
   version = "X.Y.Z"
   ```

2. Update the macros dependency version in `foundation/Cargo.toml`:
   ```toml
   [dependencies]
   uor-foundation-macros = { version = "X.Y.Z", path = "../uor-foundation-macros" }
   ```

3. Regenerate the foundation crate and commit:
   ```sh
   cargo run --bin uor-crate
   cargo fmt -- foundation/src/**/*.rs foundation/src/*.rs
   git add Cargo.toml Cargo.lock foundation/Cargo.toml foundation/src/ uor-foundation-macros/
   git commit -m "Bump version to X.Y.Z"
   ```

4. Tag and push:
   ```sh
   git tag vX.Y.Z
   git push origin main --tags
   ```

5. The release workflow will automatically:
   - Validate the tag matches the `uor-foundation` Cargo.toml version
   - Run all checks (fmt, clippy, test, conformance)
   - Regenerate the foundation crate and verify no drift
   - Verify `uor-foundation-macros` packaging with `cargo publish --dry-run`
   - Create a GitHub Release with ontology artifacts
   - Publish `uor-foundation-macros` to crates.io (must succeed first)
   - Publish `uor-foundation` to crates.io

## Published Crates

Two crates are published to crates.io (in this order):

1. `uor-foundation-macros` — proc macro providing the `uor!` DSL
2. `uor-foundation` — typed Rust traits for the ontology (depends on macros)

The internal crates (`uor-ontology`, `uor-codegen`, `uor-conformance`,
`uor-docs`, `uor-website`, `uor-clients`) are not published.

## Troubleshooting

- **Tag/version mismatch**: The workflow fails early if the tag version
  does not match `Cargo.toml`. Fix the version and re-tag.
- **Generated code drift**: If `git diff --exit-code foundation/src/` fails
  in CI, the committed generated code doesn't match the generator output.
  Run `cargo run --bin uor-crate && cargo fmt` locally and commit.
- **crates.io publish failure**: If `uor-foundation-macros` publishes but
  `uor-foundation` fails, the GitHub Release will already exist. Fix the
  issue and manually run `cargo publish -p uor-foundation`.
- **Version already published**: crates.io does not allow re-publishing
  the same version. Bump the version and create a new tag.
- **Macros version mismatch**: If `foundation/Cargo.toml` specifies a
  different version for `uor-foundation-macros` than what was published,
  the foundation publish will fail. Ensure both versions match.
