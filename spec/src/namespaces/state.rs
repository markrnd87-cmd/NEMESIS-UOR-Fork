//! `state/` namespace — Parameterized address spaces and state model (Amendment 7).
//!
//! The state namespace defines the mutable user-space model for the UOR kernel.
//! State is the user-space overlay onto the kernel's read-only substrate: contexts
//! hold bindings, frames provide visibility windows, and transitions record state
//! changes.
//!
//! **Space classification:** `user` — state is managed by user-space (Prism).
