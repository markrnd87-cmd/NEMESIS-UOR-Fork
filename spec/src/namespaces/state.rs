//! `state/` namespace — Parameterized address spaces and state model (Amendment 7).
//!
//! The state namespace defines the mutable user-space model for the UOR kernel.
//! State is the user-space overlay onto the kernel's read-only substrate: contexts
//! hold bindings, frames provide visibility windows, and transitions record state
//! changes.
//!
//! Amendment 27 adds the session lifecycle: `Session`, `BindingAccumulator`,
//! `SessionBoundary`, and `SessionBoundaryType` (a typed controlled vocabulary for
//! boundary reasons — ExplicitReset, ConvergenceBoundary, ContradictionBoundary).
//!
//! Amendment 48 adds the multi-session coordination layer: `SharedContext`,
//! `ContextLease`, and `SessionComposition` — enabling concurrent sessions on
//! disjoint site leases and composition of completed sessions.
//!
//! **Space classification:** `user` — state is managed by user-space (Prism).
