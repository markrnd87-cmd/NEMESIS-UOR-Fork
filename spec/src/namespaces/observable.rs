//! `observable/` namespace — Observable quantities and metrics.

//! Observables are kernel-computed measurements of UOR objects. They form a
//! rich taxonomy covering ring geometry, Hamming geometry, path-dependent
//! quantities, and catastrophe-theoretic measurements.
//!
//! **Space classification:** `bridge` — kernel-computed, user-requested.
