//! `resolver/` namespace — Type resolution strategies.
//!
//! Resolvers implement the map Π : T_n → Part(R_n), transforming a type
//! declaration into a partition of the ring. Resolution requests come from
//! user-space; execution occurs in the kernel.
//!
//! Amendment 11 adds iterative resolution: resolution state tracking,
//! refinement suggestions, and convergence metrics for the resolution-as-learning
//! loop.
//!
//! **Space classification:** `bridge` — user-requested, kernel-executed.
