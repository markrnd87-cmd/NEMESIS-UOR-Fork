//! `failure/` namespace — Failure algebra.
//!
//! The `failure/` namespace formalizes partial computations, typed failure
//! propagation, and recovery. Computations that cannot reach convergence are
//! represented as typed failures that compose under monoidal and parallel
//! products.
//!
//! - **Amendment 76**: 12 classes, 11 properties, 0 individuals (identities in op/)
//!
//! **Space classification:** `kernel` — immutable algebra.
