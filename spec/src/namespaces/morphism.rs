//! `morphism/` namespace — Transforms, morphisms, and the Surface Grounding Layer
//! (Amendments 6, 12, 24).
//!
//! The morphism namespace defines the abstractions for maps between UOR objects.
//! These are the things that `cert/` certificates attest to, that `trace/`
//! traces record the execution of, and that `state/` transitions capture the
//! cumulative effect of.
//!
//! Amendment 12 adds the composition primitive: the categorical backbone that
//! turns transforms into a category with identity and associative composition.
//!
//! Amendment 24 adds the **Surface Grounding Layer**: `GroundingMap` (surface symbol
//! to ring address), `ProjectionMap` (ring address neighbourhood to surface symbol
//! sequence), and `GroundingCertificate` (round-trip attestation). Together these
//! form the universal I/O boundary through which any typed surface representation
//! enters or exits the ring address space.
//!
//! **Space classification:** `user` — transforms are instantiated by applications.
