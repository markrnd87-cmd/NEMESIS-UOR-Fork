//! `query/` namespace — Information extraction queries (Amendment 24).
//!
//! Queries are the user-initiated requests for information from the UOR kernel.
//! They are kernel-executed: the user initiates a query, the kernel resolves it.
//!
//! Amendment 24 adds `RelationQuery`: a query with a grounded source address, a
//! typed relation constraint (read from the observable coordinate triple
//! `(d_R, d_H, d_I)`), and an open target `partition:FiberBudget`. This is the
//! canonical form for all relational inference across NLP, ARC-AGI grids, music,
//! images, sensor streams, and logical formulae.
//!
//! **Space classification:** `bridge` — user-initiated, kernel-executed.
