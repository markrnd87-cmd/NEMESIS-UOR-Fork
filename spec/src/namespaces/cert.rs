//! `cert/` namespace — Attestation certificates.
//!
//! Certificates are kernel-produced attestations of structural properties of
//! transforms and operations. They provide verifiable proofs that a specific
//! computation or operation satisfies a particular structural constraint.
//!
//! Amendment 25 adds `CompletenessAuditTrail` (an ordered collection of
//! `CompletenessWitness` records) with properties `auditTrail` and `witnessCount`
//! that provide full provenance for the completeness certification pathway.
//!
//! **Space classification:** `bridge` — kernel-produced, user-consumed.
