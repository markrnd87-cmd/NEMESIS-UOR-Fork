//! `derivation/` namespace — Computation witnesses via term rewriting.
//!
//! Derivations record the step-by-step rewriting of terms to their canonical
//! forms. They serve as verifiable computation witnesses.
//!
//! Amendment 11 adds `DerivationStep` as an abstract parent for `RewriteStep`
//! (term-level) and `RefinementStep` (type-level), plus properties for tracking
//! type refinement through the iterative resolution loop.
//!
//! **Space classification:** `bridge` — kernel-produced, user-consumed.
