//! `type/` namespace — Runtime type declarations.
//!
//! Types are declared at runtime by Prism applications and parameterize the
//! resolution pipeline. A type declaration tells the resolver how to partition
//! the ring into irreducible, reducible, unit, and exterior elements.
//!
//! Amendment 10 adds constraint algebra: composable predicates that refine types
//! by pinning fibers, plus metric axes that classify constraints by their
//! geometric effect.
//!
//! Amendment 25 adds the completeness certification pathway: `CompletenessCandidate`
//! (a ConstrainedType undergoing certification) and `CompletenessWitness` (a single
//! fiber-closing event), with four new properties supporting the certification loop.
//!
//! Amendment 61 adds 8 structural type individuals (ScalarType, SymbolType,
//! SequenceType, TupleType, GraphType, SetType, TreeType, TableType) as
//! instances of existing type classes with annotation properties describing
//! fiber count formulas, grounding rules, and structural constraints.
//!
//! **Space classification:** `user` — parameterizable at runtime.
