//! Types are declared at runtime by Prism applications and parameterize the

//!
//! Amendment 10 adds constraint algebra: composable predicates that refine types
//! by pinning fibers, plus metric axes that classify constraints by their
//! geometric effect.
//!
//! Amendment 25 adds the completeness certification pathway: `CompletenessCandidate`
